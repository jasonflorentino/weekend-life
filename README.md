# ðŸª¸ Life

I was reading something today that mentioned [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). I remember making a rudimentary version for my terminal with Python when I was first learning to program. So, instead of finishing what I was reading, I made this one that runs in my browser. That was fun! I guess it's time to go back to whatever it was I was reading. Even though I now just want to optimize and add features to this rudimentary version. xD
